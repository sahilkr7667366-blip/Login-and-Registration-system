# Login and Registration System

This project is a simple **C++ program** that allows users to register
and log in using their credentials. It demonstrates the use of file
handling, conditional statements, and basic input/output operations in
C++.

## Features

-   User **registration** with a username and password\
-   User **login** with authentication\
-   **File handling** to store and retrieve user data\
-   Simple and beginner-friendly C++ implementation

## Requirements

-   C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`, or MinGW for Windows)\
-   Basic understanding of C++

## How to Compile

``` bash
g++ Login\ and\ Registration\ System.cpp -o login_system
```

## How to Run

``` bash
./login_system
```

(Use `login_system.exe` on Windows)

## Example Flow

1.  User chooses **Register** and enters a username & password.\
2.  User chooses **Login** and enters their credentials.\
3.  If the credentials match, login is successful. Otherwise, an error
    is shown.
